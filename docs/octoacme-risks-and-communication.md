# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support, design, data)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Coordinate with Support Lead for customer-facing communications
- Share design updates with stakeholders (coordinated by UX Designer)
- Distribute data insights and experiment results (from Data Analyst)

## Communication Templates
Weekly Status Template:

Incident Communication
- Triage summary
- Actions being taken
- Expected timeline
- Post-incident blameless retrospective scheduled
- Customer communication (coordinated with Support Lead)

- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call
