# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the **OctoAcme Project Management Docs**! This collection provides a comprehensive guide to how OctoAcme plans, executes, and delivers projects. Whether you're a new team member getting up to speed or an experienced contributor looking for best practices, these docs will help you understand our approach to project management.

## Our Approach

At OctoAcme, we believe in delivering value through disciplined, customer-focused project management. Our processes are designed to:

- **Put customers first** — We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Deliver iteratively** — We ship small, testable increments to learn and adapt quickly
- **Ensure clear ownership** — Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Make data-informed decisions** — We measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Maintain psychological safety** — We encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement
- **Create consistent artifacts** — We use standard templates and documentation to ensure clarity and alignment
